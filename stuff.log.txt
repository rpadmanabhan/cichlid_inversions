scaffold_173:441,041-445,606	Small inversion, MZ has inverted reads, MC has none 

scaffold_115:2,174,860-2,188,580	Relatively Smaller Inverion, MZ clearly has more inverted reads 

scaffold_29:5,966,217-6,476,437	Some Inverted Reads at the ends, odd insert sizes present upstream of inversion start 

scaffold_307:198,817-253,832	Looking at the break points both seem to have inverted reads

scaffold_115:2,174,860-2,188,580	Inverted reads present in both, lot more in MZ

scaffold_90:1,329,004-1,395,229	Inversions in MC at the breakpoints, lots of duplication events seem to show up in both MC and MZ

scaffold_363:137,692-216,753	Some Inverted Reads present at the breakpoints in both, more in MZ

scaffold_301:5,836-393,767	Some Inverted Reads present at the breakpoints in bot

scaffold_363:137,692-216,753	Inverted reads present, more in MZ, coverage is poor in this region 

scaffold_153:361,932-1,296,362	Some inverted reads at the breakpoints in both, duplication events in the inversion region

scaffold_78:2,294,942-3,057,621 Odd, doesnt seem to have inverted reads

scaffold_80:623,023-1,473,658	Inverted reads at the breakpoints, MZ seems to have more
