scaffold_173:441,041-445,606	Small inversion, MZ has inverted reads, MC has none	No FST information

scaffold_115:2,174,860-2,188,580	Relatively Smaller Inverion, MZ clearly has more inverted reads	scaffold_115	450001	460000	0.705794 

scaffold_29:5,966,217-6,476,437	Some Inverted Reads at the ends, odd insert sizes present upstream of inversion start	lots of FST bins

scaffold_307:198,817-253,832	Looking at the break points both seem to have inverted reads	No FST information	

scaffold_115:2,174,860-2,188,580	Inverted reads present in both, lot more in MZ	scaffold_115	450001	460000	0.705794

scaffold_90:1,329,004-1,395,229	Inversions in MC at the breakpoints, lots of duplication events seem to show up in both MC and MZ	scaffold_90	1400001	1410000	0.718129
